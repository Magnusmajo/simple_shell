### What is a Shell in Computing?

In computing, a shell is a computer program that exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

Functioning:
The shell processes commands entered by the user and sends them to the kernel of the operating system for execution.
It allows you to explore the directory tree, create, edit, and delete files, and run programs.
Accessing the Command Line:
You can access the command line through a terminal (such as xterm, kterm, or gterm).
Virtual consoles (tty) also provide access to the command line from the graphical interface.
Logging In on a Virtual Console:
When prompted for login, enter your username and password.
If the password is valid, the prompt will appear, indicating a successful connection.
